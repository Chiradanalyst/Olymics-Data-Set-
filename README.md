CTE &amp; Window Function Practice
With this project, I wanted to explore Window Fuctions & Common Table Expression(CTE). 
My goal was to succesfully integrate both tools into work to make my query simplers to write and read. 

The Questions that I set out to answer are
  -Q1 What countries had the largest GDP in 2016?
  -Q2 How many events did each country compete in across both summer and winter games?
  -Q3 What female players are over the age of 30 and have an above average height & weight?
  -Q4 What countrys competed in the winter games and won more than 5 gold medals?
  -Q5 What countries had a decrease in total population from 2001 to 2006?
